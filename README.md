## Background

The idea for this app came about from this team's mutual love of theme parks and especially roller coasters. Our inspiration was to create a Yelp-type app specifically for roller coasters and the people who love them. Our app currently lists all the roller coasters in PA and their specifications, and it allows users to rate the coaster and save it to their profile along with how many times they've ridden it. 

**End result:** Coaster Catalog is fun, interactive roller coaster index for thrill-seekers of all ages. It provides organized, accessible information about roller coasters so people can quicky find their next great ride.


## How it works

### Features available before Sign In

**Coaster Index 1**

Any user can log on to site URL and get a full list of the parks and roller coasters in the state of Pennsylvania by using the "Parks & Coasters" menu item in the navigation bar.

**Coaster Index 2**

General users can also interact with the map of PA by hovering over the dots and squares, to see where the amusement parks are located geographically and see which roller coasters are located at that park.

**Coaster Index 3**

Additionally, users have the option to page through the alphabetical list of all the roller coasters in PA. The location of the roller coaster is listed on each "Coaster Card" as well as the coasters current user rating average, and a color tab that corresponds with the color of the dot on the PA map where the coaster is located.

**"I RODE IT" buttons unlocked on Home page**

After users create a profile and are logged in, they can return to the home page and page through the alphabetical list of all the roller coasters in PA. However, since they are logged in, they now see an "I RODE IT" button that they can quickly click on and add to their profile. After a user clicks on an "I RODE IT" button in a Coaster Card, that coaster card will now appear in that users profile, and the button will disappear indicating that the button has been clicked.

**"I RODE IT" buttons unlocked on Coaster Profile pages**

After users have created a profile and are logged in, they can also navigate to any of the Coaster Profile pages and see the "I RODE IT" button. If the "I RODE IT" button is green and active, then a user has not added that coaster to their profile. If the "I RODE IT" button is blue, disabled, and the message, "Coaster has been added to your profile" is visible, then a user has successfully added that coaster to their profile.

**Counters for Total Number of Coasters Ridden and Total Number of Rides**

Additionally, after users create a profile and are logged in, they can go to the "Profile" page and see a complete list of how many roller coasters they have ridden, and how many times they have ridden each roller coaster. This is also where users can submit their rating of each roller coaster they rode.
